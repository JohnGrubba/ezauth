# Demo Setup

This is a demo setup for EZAuth. It includes the official Image from Docker Hub and a docker-compose file to run the instance.
Just copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to your server and run `docker-compose up -d` to start the instance.
All Configuration is done in the `config` folder. [(Read the Docs for more information)](https://johngrubba.github.io/ezauth/)
